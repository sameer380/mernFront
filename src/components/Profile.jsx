						{" "}
						Ours is the first college in the jurisdiction of Acharya Nagarjuna
						University to get accreditation at 'A' level by the National
						Assessment and Accreditation Council (NAAC), Bengaluru. The
						jurisdiction of the college was shifted to Krishna University,
						Machilipatnam from the academic year 2009-‘10. The University Grants
						Commission (UGC) has conferred the status of “College with Potential
						for Excellence (CPE)” on our college. NAAC reaccredited our college
						at the level ‘A’ with 3.23 points on 4 point scale. The college
						works for a minimum of 90 instructional days in each semester.
						Though Vijayawada grew as one of the major cities in Andhra Pradesh
						with accelerated trade, commerce, industry and political
						enlightenment, there were very few educational institutions of
						repute four decades ago. Hence the idea of establishing a premiere
						educational complex had been incubating in the minds of the
						philanthropic elite of Vijayawada for a long time which materialized
						into concrete reality in 1975 through the synergy of 250 educated
						and visionary people drawn from different noble professions to
						establish the “Academy of General and Technical Education.”

					<p>
						In the year 1975, away from the ceaseless bustle of the trading
						yards, the criss-cross of trains through this junction to every part
						of the country and the majestic gush of the Krishna waters through
						the spillways of the Prakasam barrage, some best minds were in
						unison for a noble cause in Vijayawada. Each of them represented a
						zenith of achievement in the galaxies as diverse as medicine,
						engineering, accounting, jurisprudence, industry and business. They
						were all the sons of the soil. Each of them experienced the travails
						and hardships of travelling great distances and to strange lands in
						pursuit of their education. With their native intelligence and
						commitment proven the emergent property in both the physical and
						educational realms.
					</p>
					<p>
						They not only interacted but also integrated to provide new
						dimensions to the cause, phenomenal increase in the number of
						institutions, while looking for holistic education. They were in
						conclave to make beginning for providing the educational awareness
						to meet the needs of the region. Vijayawada, devoid of a single
						post-graduate or professional institution at that time, became the
						hub of educational needs of the state of Andhra Pradesh. It is but
						for the Academy, the transformation of Vijayawada from an
						Intellectual Sahara to a vibrant education centre like the Nalanda.
						That was the background of birth of the ‘Academy of General and
						Technical Education', which was rechristened later as 'Siddhartha
						Academy of General & Technical Education', The Academy all these
						years is striving hard to outreach the youth to get their education
						that not only makes them qualified for the job, but also enables to
						equip themselves to struggle for life, brings out a strength of
						character, a spirit of philosophy and the courage of a lion- i.e.
						wholesome development of a human.
					</p>{" "}
					<p>
						They believe the education is the one by which character is formed,
						strength of mind is increased, the intellect is expanded and by
						which one can stand on one's feet, which is the spirit of Swamy
						Vivekananda. Human making, life building and character assimilation
						ideas are imparted in all the institutions under their surveillance.
						Since its inception it has been making heroic attempts to promote
						quality educational institutions with excellent infrastructure to
						serve the cause of education as a veritable university. The Academy
						employs 1,200 dedicated teachers in various faculty positions and
						has a massive enrolment of 21050 students in the institutions
						sponsored by it.
